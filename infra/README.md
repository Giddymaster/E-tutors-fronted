# E-Tutors Infrastructure Documentation

## Overview
The E-Tutors infrastructure is designed to support a modern two-sided marketplace application that connects students with verified tutors. This document outlines the setup and configuration of the infrastructure components necessary for the application to function effectively.

## Directory Structure
- **docker/**: Contains Dockerfiles for backend and frontend applications.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the services and configurations for running the application in Docker.

## Docker Setup
To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Images**
   Navigate to the `infra` directory and run the following command to build the images:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Containers**
   After building the images, you can start the application by running:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Accessing the Application**
   Once the containers are running, you can access the frontend and backend applications through the specified ports in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Environment Variables
Make sure to configure the necessary environment variables in a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided in the root directory. This file should include database connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive information required for the application.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine before proceeding with the setup.
- For any issues or troubleshooting, refer to the logs generated by the Docker containers.

This documentation will be updated as the infrastructure evolves.
